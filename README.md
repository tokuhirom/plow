plow - easy to work
===================

plow is perl + php-ish easyness.

Perl is great, but it has some tiresome things. Plow resolve it.

## plow?

    class MyClass {
      method run() {
      }
    }

## What's difference between perl5i?

(TBD)

## Plan

### Do not use Path::Class?

Need to implement original one?

### autoboxing?

### static method
